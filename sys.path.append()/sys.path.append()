How do you append directories to your Python path?

Your path (the list of directories Python goes through(usar bastante alguma coisa) to search for modules and files) is stored in the "path"
attribute of the sys module. Since (como) path is a list, you can use the append method to add new directories to the path.

For example, to add the directory /home/me/mypy to the path, just do:
import sys
sys.path.append("/home/me/mypy")
